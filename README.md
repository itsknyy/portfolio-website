## ✨ Vibe-coded

This project was **vibe-coded** — built with a clear visual and interaction goal in mind, using AI as a productivity and refinement tool.

AI was used to:
- iterate on UI and layout ideas  
- refine styling and animations  
- improve clarity and consistency  

All structure, logic, and final decisions were intentionally implemented and reviewed by me.
